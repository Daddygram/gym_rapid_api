## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from Node.js.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gym-web-project.git
cd gym-web-project
```
## Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
Running the App
```

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
```sh
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Running Tests
To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, use:

```sh
npm test
See the section about running tests for more information.
```

## Building for Production
To build the app for production to the build folder, use:

```sh
npm run build
```

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## Ejecting
If you need to customize the configuration and dependencies:

```sh
